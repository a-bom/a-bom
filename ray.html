  <p>Born in 1922, Raymond dedicated his life to the Jehovah's Witnesses religion after being baptized in 1939. In 1971 he became a member of the ruling council of the Jehovah's Witnesses called the Governing Body. During his service in the Governing Body, Raymond discovered discrepancies between the teachings of the Bible and the teachings of his Church, and dared to ask other Jehovah's Witnesses leaders about the discrepancies.</p>
    <p>
    Because of his honesty regarding the sect he had dedicated his life to and because he associated with a person disfellowshipped (excommunicated) from the Church, Raymond was excommunicated from the Jehovah's Witnesses. He refused a monthly stipend from the Church, was shunned by his community, and was ultimately betrayed by the men he had served with so diligently. All this because he valued truth, human dignity, and compassion.</p>

<p>In 2009 I read Raymond's book, <em>Crisis of Conscience</em>. Raymond's firm portrayal of the truth while giving the benefit of the doubt to the men who betrayed him helped me heal from betrayal I experienced. I wrote him a letter to express my gratitude for his book. I received his response dated May 9th, 2010. In it he said:
      </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
Life inevitably has its negative aspects, but we can deal with these as they require and then put them behind us. The past may be beyond our changing, but the present and the future are things we can work with, focus on. If we let resentment or bitterness control us, then we are, as one scholar put it, "prisoners of the past." When we find the power to put the past to rest, we set a prisoner free--and we have been that prisoner.
      <cite>Raymond Franz, May 9th, 2010</cite>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

<p style="text-align:center;">     Raymond died about three and a half weeks after writing me that letter. <br>
  I'll always be grateful for his kind response.
<br>
Rest in peace Raymond
      </p>
