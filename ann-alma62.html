  <p>The only pre-Columbian weapon I can find that was similar
  to a sword was the macuahuitl which was made with a plank of wood similar in
  shape to a cricket bat with obsidian blades mounted on the edges. It is
  similar enough to a sword that it is often referred to as the Aztec sword.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, the macuahuitl does not seem to fit the Book of
  Mormon time frame. “Some groups of Central Mexico, principally in the
  transition between the <b>Early and the Late Post-Classic</b>, probably
  developed this weapon” (emphasis added, Dr. Marco Antonio Cervera Obregón, “The
  macuahuitl: an innovative weapon of the Late Post-Classic in Mesoamerica”,
  Arms &amp; Armour, Vol.3, Nov. 2, 2006, p. 146, <a href="http://www.woosterglobalhistory.org/LAcolonial/archive/files/23395812_33c717a7fb.pdf" target="_blank">article from a research journal</a>).
  The Post-Classic period is between 900 CE and the Spanish conquest.</p>
