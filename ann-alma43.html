  <p>The only pre-Columbian weapon I can find that was similar
  to a sword was the macuahuitl which was made with a plank of wood similar in
  shape to a cricket bat with obsidian blades mounted on the edges. It is
  similar enough to a sword that it is often referred to as the Aztec sword.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, the macuahuitl does not seem to fit the Book of
  Mormon time frame. “Some groups of Central Mexico, principally in the
  transition between the <b>Early and the Late Post-Classic</b>, probably
  developed this weapon” (emphasis added, Dr. Marco Antonio Cervera Obregón, “The
  macuahuitl: an innovative weapon of the Late Post-Classic in Mesoamerica”,

  <p>Some LDS apologists argue that the swords and cimeters of
  the Book of Mormon were weapons of stone or some other material besides metal
  because no swords have been found in the archaeological record and metallurgy
  seems to have been quite limited in the Americas at the time. One of the
  problems with this is how unlikely it would be for such weapons to do the
  damage described here. This damage might be possible for steel weapons
  (though it doesn’t seem likely even for steel swords to cut off many arms),
  but not for stone or other such materials.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The only pre-Columbian weapon I can find that was similar
  to a sword was the macuahuitl which was made with a plank of wood similar in
  shape to a cricket bat with obsidian blades mounted on the edges. It is
  similar enough to a sword that it is often referred to as the Aztec sword.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, the macuahuitl does not seem to fit the Book of
  Mormon time frame. “Some groups of Central Mexico, principally in the
  transition between the <b>Early and the Late Post-Classic</b>, probably
  developed this weapon” (emphasis added, Dr. Marco Antonio Cervera Obregón, “The
  macuahuitl: an innovative weapon of the Late Post-Classic in Mesoamerica”,
  Arms &amp; Armour, Vol.3, Nov. 2, 2006, p. 146, <a

  The Post-Classic period is between 900 CE and the Spanish conquest.</p>
