  <p>The only pre-Columbian weapon I can find that was similar

  similar enough to a sword that it is often referred to as the Aztec sword.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, the macuahuitl does not seem to fit the Book of Mormon
  time frame. “Some groups of Central Mexico, principally in the transition
  between the <b>Early and the Late Post-Classic</b>, probably developed this
  weapon” (emphasis added, Dr. Marco Antonio Cervera Obregón, “The macuahuitl:
  an innovative weapon of the Late Post-Classic in Mesoamerica”, Arms &amp;

  <p>The only pre-Columbian weapon I can find that was similar
  to a sword was the macuahuitl which was made with a plank of wood similar in
  shape to a cricket bat with obsidian blades mounted on the edges. It is
  similar enough to a sword that it is often referred to as the Aztec sword.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, the macuahuitl does not seem to fit the Book of
  Mormon time frame. “Some groups of Central Mexico, principally in the transition
  between the <b>Early and the Late Post-Classic</b>, probably developed this
  weapon” (emphasis added, Dr. Marco Antonio Cervera Obregón, “The macuahuitl:
  an innovative weapon of the Late Post-Classic in Mesoamerica”, Arms &amp;
  Armour, Vol.3, Nov. 2, 2006, p. 146, <a
  href="https://preview.tinyurl.com/y6n3mzct">https://preview.tinyurl.com/y6n3mzct</a>).
  The Post-Classic period is between 900 CE and the Spanish conquest.</p>
  <p><br>
  And, a sword-like weapon even with sharp stone on its edge would not be able
  to cut off arms like this, certainly not multiple arms.</p>

  Also, how is it that he “slew none save it were their leader,” but then it
  tells us he cut off “not a few” arms? apparently these guys, “not a few,”
  survived having their arms cut off in spite of the medical knowledge (or lack
  thereof) in about 91 BCE. There’s the initial blood loss, and let’s not
  forget the likelihood of infection even if somehow a person did survive the
  initial wound back then.</p>
