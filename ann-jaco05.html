  <p>Some have criticized the fact that this olive tree
  allegory takes place in a vineyard. That might seem a little questionable,
  but my understanding is that olive trees are commonly grown in vineyards
  (correct me if I’m wrong on this) at least in some regions. At worst, I think
  the fact that the setting is in a vineyard may be an unnecessary detail that
  can distract from the rest of the allegory.</p>

  </td>
  <td>
  <p>Allegories use symbolism in story form to teach an
  underlying moral or theme. This allegory presents some problems in Book of
  Mormon context though.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>First of all, the Nephites don’t have any olive trees, so
  this aspect of the story would fall pretty flat for such an audience.
  Secondly this story is extremely verbose (see Jacob 4:1 for how difficult it
  was to engrave the plates, but this long allegory somehow merits the effort?).
  The story is confusing, has the Lord of the vineyard taking direction from
  the workers, and requires Jacob to explain some of it in the next chapter. <br>
  <br>
  If I had to engrave the principles taught here on metal plates, I think I’d
  write something like:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;1 The House of Israel will be scattered because of its
  wickedness. (And, as may be inferred symbolically from the story, scattering
  or hardship can actually lead to growth.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;2 Gentiles will be adopted into the covenant and do good works.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;3 Eventually many of the gentiles will start being evil and be
  cast off.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;4 The scattered remnant of Israel will be gathered back, repent,
  and do good works.</p>
  <p>  5 In the end, the good will be rewarded by the Lord
  through His work (His atonement), the bad will receive endless damnation
  (which is not the same as damnation with no end—it is damnation of the
  Lord—see D&amp;C 19:6-12).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In 2 Ne 31:3 Nephi says, “My soul delighteth in plainness;
  for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men.” How
  does this allegory fit with that assertion?</p>
