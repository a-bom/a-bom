  <p>Such a mind could lead to irrational or unfounded beliefs,

  someone claims Mormons believe in Mormonism because of frenzied or deranged
  minds, I’d defend the Mormons as generally not having frenzied or deranged
  minds. Many non-Mormons may think the beliefs of Mormonism are strange or

  <p id="17">17 And many more such things did he say unto them, telling
  them that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but <b>every

  every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered

  </td>
  <td>
  <p>It’s interesting that many Mormons believe that atheists
  commonly think “whatsoever a man did was no crime.” Thing is, this philosophy
  seems to be like some fringe form of anarchism. I’m sure there are some
  atheist anarchists, but I don’t think they are common. Alternatively, if by
  “crime” this verse means “sin” or “immoral act,” then such a person who
  believes that whatever they do is not bad or immoral is a sociopath. Again, I’m
  sure there are some atheists who are also sociopaths, but I don’t think they
  are common.<br>
  <br>
  I remember thinking as a believer about atheists in this way. My reasoning
  was something to the effect of, “If you believe in no God and no eternal
  judgment, then there is no purpose to anything, so what’s to stop you from
  doing whatever you want, even raping or murdering?” This kind of reasoning
  fails to account for morality without belief in God. It fails to account for
  the desire to have joy and to help others have joy even if you have no belief
  in a god. It fails to account for the fact that most atheists realize that
  joy is in many ways inextricable from pro-social behavior.<br>
  <br>
  The part about faring according to the management of the creature, prospering
  according to one’s genius, and conquering according to one’s strength seems
  confirmed as true in Alma 10:4&amp;5: <br>
  “I have also acquired much riches by the hand of my industry. Nevertheless,
  after all this, I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries
  and marvelous power” <br>
  (Amulek explaining that he prospered according to his genius).<br>
  <br>
  Also in Alma 10:32:<br>
  “Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain and they got gain according
  to their employ.”</p>

  Notice the irony in this. <br>
  <br>
  According to Alma 30:7-9 and 11, Korihor had committed no crime and the law
  provided that a person could not be punished for their belief. Yet the people
  of Ammon who “were more wise” took Korihor, and bound him, and carried him
  before Ammon. Who committed the crime here?<br>
  <br>
  So much for the freedom of religion indicated in Alma 30:9.<br>
  <br>
  Reminds me of this quote by A. C. Grayling:</p>
  <p><br>
  “Religious apologists complain bitterly that atheists and secularists are
  aggressive and hostile in their criticism of them. I always say: look, when
  you guys were in charge, you didn’t argue with us, you just burnt us at the
  stake. Now what we’re doing is, we’re presenting you with some arguments and
  some challenging questions, and you complain.”</p>

  <br>
  Again, notice the irony. <br>
  <br>
  I believe modern general authorities do receive money from the Church.<br>
  <br>
  “The living allowances given the General Authorities, which are very modest
  in comparison with executive compensation in industry and the professions,
  come from this business income and not from the tithing of the people”<br>
  (President Gordon B. Hinckley, “Questions and Answers,” October 1985 General
  Conference).<br>
  <br>
  First of all “modest in comparison with executive compensation” could easily
  include 6-figure annual allowances. That’s much more than your average
  person. But we will never know until the Church discloses its finances. Why
  would they hide their finances? Not all, but many other Churches voluntarily
  disclose finances. None of this is in keeping with what Alma argues against
  Korihor.<br>
  <br>
  I was wrong when I wrote the above. We found out part of what LDS general
  authorities make even though the Church did not disclose its finances.
  MormonLeaks provided documentation that as of January 2014, the base living
  allowance given to LDS general authorities was $120,000 annually</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Alma and his Church are making extraordinary claims of an
  all-powerful God who intercedes in the affairs of man. Since he and his
  Church initiate the extraordinary claim, the burden of proof would generally
  be theirs. However, because the character Korihor has claimed “there shall be
  no Christ,” as if he knows that, then Korihor would have the burden of proof
  to claim to know such a thing. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The current Book of Mormon Student Manual for Religion
  121-122 copyrighted 2009 makes a very good point on page 217 that I’ll
  paraphrase in the rest of this paragraph. In Alma 30:15, Korihor argues, “Ye
  cannot know of things which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that
  there shall be a Christ.” In verse 22 of this chapter Korihor is accused of
  asserting “that there shall be no Christ,” and he seems to admit this in
  verse 23. Yet, by his own reasoning, Korihor cannot know that there shall not
  be a Christ. By his reasoning, he would have to be able to see all things in
  the universe to know that there was no Christ. It is a good reminder that
  proclaiming to know something that is not falsifiable is not rational. It
  would have been much more rational for Korihor to proclaim that since he sees
  no evidence for Christ, there is no reason to believe in Christ.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Alma asserts that all things testify that there is a God
  and that Christ will come. But isn’t that just Alma’s interpretation of all
  things? What of the cruel and horrific torment of the innocent (even small
  children) by human depravity and by nature? Many interpret this to show that
  there is no omnipotent, all-caring God. The argument is that if such a God
  were omnipotent, then he doesn’t care enough to end unnecessary suffering, or
  if he cares, then he must be impotent to end the suffering. At any rate, it
  doesn’t necessarily follow that because of the universe, therefore God
  exists. A person may feel like the existence, order, or beauty of the
  universe testifies of this, but feelings lead to all sorts of contradictory
  conclusions. Look at all the people who have felt the Spirit of God
  testifying that theirs is the only true Church even though theirs is not the
  LDS Church (for examples, see this video:  <a

  <p>I have personally been accused of seeking signs because I
  have expressed that I will not believe in extraordinary claims without
  extraordinary evidence, but let’s consider what it means to seek for signs in
  the context of the Book of Mormon. Here are a couple of examples where proof
  and evidence apparently led to belief in a good way:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>2 Ne 11:4, 6-7 - Nephi’s “soul delighteth in proving unto
  [his] people the truth.”<br>
  <br>
  Helaman 5:50 - Prisoners see sons of Helaman, Nephi and Lehi, encircled as if
  by fire; see angels; and hear voices. When the prisoners told the Lamanites
  about this, “the more part of the Lamanites were convinced of them, because
  of the greatness of the evidences.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And, don’t forget that Samuel the Lamanite describes the
  signs of the death of the savior (Helaman 14:20-27) then tells us that these
  signs were “to the intent that there should be no cause for unbelief among
  the children of men—And this to the intent that whosoever will believe might
  be saved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment might
  come upon them” (Helaman 14:28-29). Doesn’t the explanation by Samuel make
  more sense? Shouldn’t I be held accountable for following the evidence
  wherever it leads rather than to be held accountable to extraordinary claims
  with no substantial evidence?</p>

  the form of an angel speaking as with a voice of thunder and the whole earth
  shaking (Alma 36:6-7). Now in this verse, this same Alma strikes Korihor dumb

  Korihor’s ignominious death (verse 59).</p>

  no sense at all. Maybe there are some atheists like this, but they have to be
  an amazingly small percentage of the population of atheists.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Regarding Book of Mormon anti-Christs, it’s been said:<br>
  “They are all of one breed and brand; so nearly alike that one mind is the
  author of them, and that a young and underdeveloped, but piously inclined
  mind. The evidence I sorrowfully submit, points to Joseph Smith as their
  creator” (B. H. Roberts, member of the first council of the seventy from
  about 1888).<br>

  go out and again try to lead away the hearts of the people. Couldn’t God just
  shut him down again?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Another problem with this curse is the often used argument
  regarding the problem of evil. The problem being that if God exists, he
  allows unspeakable suffering, including that inflicted by sadistic humans.
  The argument is that God allows this human-inflicted suffering because if he
  interceded and stopped it, he would be interfering or diminishing the moral
  agency of the perpetrator. Yet, this curse is a canonized example of God
  interceding by cursing a would-be evil doer to prevent suffering (in this
  case suffering caused by being led away from God).</p>
