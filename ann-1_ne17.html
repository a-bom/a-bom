  This is the account of what the “righteous” Israelites did to the people of
  Jericho. </p>

  man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of
  the sword.”<br>

  Another example of sacred text justifying genocide, even of children and babies.
  Fortunately, this seems to be fiction.<br>

  Regarding whether the Israelite conquest of Jericho really happen as the
  Bible describes it, Archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon said, “most historians and
  Bible scholars would answer with a resounding ‘No, certainly not! There was
  no city there at the time Joshua supposedly conquered it’”<br>

  mythical creature?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some versions of be Bible use “poisonous” in the place of
  “fiery.” It’s also been explained that even modern Arab usage of the term
  “flying” can refer to quickness or speed. So the creature described in the
  biblical could simply be referring to snakes. But, since the Book of Mormon
  is supposed to be translated by the power of God, and the process gave each
  English word to Joseph to use (<a

  one is left to wonder why God would use this expression given a modern
  English audience.</p>
