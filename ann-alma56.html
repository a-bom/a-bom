  <p>Alma 56:46-48<br>
  <br>
  Doesn’t this contradict Alma 60:12-13?<br>
    12  Do ye suppose that, because so many of your brethren have been killed
  it is because of their wickedness? I say unto you, if ye have supposed this
  ye have supposed in vain; for I say unto you, there are many who have fallen
  by the sword; and behold it is to your condemnation;<br>
    13  For the Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice and
  judgment may come upon the wicked; therefore ye need not suppose that the
  righteous are lost because they are slain; but behold, they do enter into the
  rest of the Lord their God.<br>
  <br>
  History shows repeatedly that even the most faithful are often killed in
  battle. Why were these stripling fighters spared, but other faithful
  believers are not? How would this variation between those who are spared and
  those who are not be different in a world with no intervening God?<br>
  <br>
  Sometimes when the problem of evil is expressed, apologists will argue that
  God allows evil to be perpetrated because he values moral agency so much that
  he will not intercede on behalf of the victim out of respect for the agency
  of the perpetrator.<br>
  <br>
  Hopefully most will find this idea of unwillingness to intercede repugnant
  without further explanation. However, for those needing more explanation,
  notice that this verse actually affirms that God will intercede to prevent
  wickedness.</p>

  <p>The only pre-Columbian weapon I can find that was similar
  to a sword was the macuahuitl which was made with a plank of wood similar in
  shape to a cricket bat with obsidian blades mounted on the edges. It is
  similar enough to a sword that it is often referred to as the Aztec sword.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, the macuahuitl does not seem to fit the Book of
  Mormon time frame. “Some groups of Central Mexico, principally in the
  transition between the <b>Early and the Late Post-Classic</b>, probably
  developed this weapon” (emphasis added, Dr. Marco Antonio Cervera Obregón, “The
  macuahuitl: an innovative weapon of the Late Post-Classic in Mesoamerica”,
